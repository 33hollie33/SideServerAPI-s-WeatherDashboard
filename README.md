# ThirdPartyAPI-WeatherDashboard
In this challenge it was to create a WeatherDashboard to allow users to see the Weather in any given City or Country, during anytime. To achieve this, a Third Party API was used to retrieve the data and display it on the website. In addition, the criteria was for the user to be able to store the locations they have previously researched, to enable user to research for multiple cities at once. By using local storage, it would allow the user to see what they have previously looked at. 

The dashboard must also have a display of five days worth of weather for the user displayed below the current date. The data that is presented to the user must have the City name, Weather conditions, the humidity and the Wind speed. The challenge required the website to have icons to visually show the user what the weather would be like in addition to the information. This challenge provided no starter code. Therefore, starting from sratch. The following was used to achieve the final product: HTML, CSS, Vanilla JavaScript, Local storage, Third part API.
