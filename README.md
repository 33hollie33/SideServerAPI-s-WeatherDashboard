# ThirdPartyAPI-WeatherDashboard
In this challenge it was to create a WeatherDashboard to allow users to see the Weather in any given City or Country, during anytime. To achieve this, a Third Party API was used to retrieve the data and display it on the website. In addition, the criteria was fdor the user to be able to store the locations they have previously researched, to enable user to research for multiple cities at once. The dashboard must also have a display of five days worth of weather for the user. The data that is presented to the user must have the City name, Weather conditions, The humidity and the Wind speed. This challenge provided no starter code.
